# Alarm Clock

This project is an implementation of an alarm clock using Python. It utilizes the `datetime` and `tkinter` libraries to leverage the current date and time and provide a user interface to set the alarm in a 12/24-hour format.

## Features

- Set an alarm time by specifying the hour and minute.
- The alarm will trigger a pop-up message box when the set time is reached.
- The alarm can be snoozed for a specified number of minutes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually included in standard Python distributions)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the Tkinter library if it is not already included with your Python distribution.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run the following command to start the alarm clock:

```shell
python alarm_clock.py
```

## Usage

1. The alarm clock application will open with a graphical user interface.
2. Set the alarm time by selecting the hour and minute from the drop-down menus.
3. Click the "Set Alarm" button to activate the alarm.
4. At the set alarm time, a pop-up message box will appear, indicating that the alarm has triggered.
5. To snooze the alarm, click the "Snooze" button, and the alarm will be delayed by the specified number of minutes.
6. To stop the alarm, simply close the pop-up message box.

## Customization

If you want to modify the appearance or behavior of the alarm clock, you can make changes to the `alarm_clock.py` file. The code is well-commented to help you understand and modify different sections of the application.
